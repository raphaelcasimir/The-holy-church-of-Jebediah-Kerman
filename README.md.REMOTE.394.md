# The Holy Church of Jebediah Kerman
(Shared KSP saves)

His highness **Saint Jebediah of Kerusalem** will welcome you in his Holy Church, and you will be blessed by his badassitude.
Praise his holiness Jebediah of Kerusalem the new messiah of space travel!

Sing the Tales of Jebediah! He came all the way from the distant countries of Minmus, nearly naked in his EVA pack, fought the deadly atmosphere of Kerbin and survived the thousands kilometers fall. He did that by love of Kerbality! Praise the Kord!
